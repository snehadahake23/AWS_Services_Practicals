## 🛠️ AWS Services Used
- AWS Lambda
- IAM
- Lambda Layers
- Amazon SNS
- Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)

## 🔄 Architecture Flow
1. EventBridge triggers the report Lambda on a schedule
2. Report Lambda fetches DB credentials from Parameter Store
3. Report Lambda invokes Data Extractor Lambda
4. Data Extractor Lambda connects and fetches sales data
5. Report Lambda formats the data
6. Report is sent via SNS email notification
